# Mutual-Fund-Plan-with-Python
A Python-based analysis of Mutual Fund SIP returns. This project calculates compound interest, tracks wealth milestones (e.g., hitting 1 Crore), and visualizes the "magic moment" when interest earned exceeds the principal investment.

# 📈 SIP Wealth & Compound Interest Analyzer

## 🚀 Project Overview
   This project is a Python-based data analysis tool designed to simulate and visualize the power of compounding in Mutual Fund Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). 
   It mathematically models a **15-year investment journey** to demonstrate how small, consistent contributions can grow into significant wealth, highlighting specific financial      milestones (like becoming a "Crorepati").

## 📊 Key Features
   **Compounding Engine:** A custom loop logic to calculate monthly compound interest on a running balance.
   **Wealth Milestones:** Automatically detects and logs when the portfolio crosses key values (e.g., ₹50 Lakhs, ₹1 Crore).
   **Yearly Breakdown:** Aggregates data to analyze annual growth vs. annual investment.
   **Advanced Visualization:**
      ***Donut Chart:** Visualizes the ratio of Principal Amount vs. Free Money (Interest).
      ***Bar Chart:** Demonstrates the "Magic Moment" where the interest earned in a single year surpasses the amount invested that year.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
   **Language:** Python 3.x
   **Libraries:**
    * `pandas` (Data manipulation)
    * `numpy` (Numerical operations)
    * `matplotlib` (Static visualizations)
    * `seaborn` (Styling)

## 🔢 Simulation Parameters
   The current analysis is based on the following conservative/aggressive estimates:
     **Monthly Investment:** ₹25,000
     **Expected Annual Return:** 15%
     **Duration:** 15 Years

## 📈 Insights from Analysis
  Based on the code execution:
  1.  **Total Investment:** ₹45,00,000
  2.  **Final Portfolio Value:** ~₹1.69 Crores
  3.  **The "Crorepati" Milestone:** Hit in **Year 12, Month 144**.
  4.  **The Power of Compounding:** By the end of the term, the "Interest Earned" component accounts for **73.4%** of the total portfolio value, while the actual capital invested         is only **26.6%**.

## 📸 Visualizations

### 1. Portfolio Breakdown
   A donut chart showing how much of the final value is your own money vs. profit generated by the market.

### 2. The "Magic Moment"
  A bar chart comparing "Annual Investment" vs. "Annual Interest." It visually highlights the year where your money starts working harder than you do.
